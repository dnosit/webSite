                    <h3> From Science to Technology </h3>
                    <p> I have over 10 years experience in Science, Technology and Teaching roles. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Also having a life-long passion for computer systems and technology, 
                        I have recently undertaken formal education to specialise in Information Technology.

                    <h3>Information Technology | Bachelor of Information Technology (QUT) </h3>
                    <p>I have always been interested in technology and have undertaken many projects in my spare time
                        before my formal tertiary education began. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I have also assumed minor level-1 IT support roles prior to this. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This experience improved my ability to communicate with customers 
                        and ensure they are getting the service they expect.

                    <h3>Teaching</h3> 
                    <h3>English  | TEFL Course (Costa Rica)
                        <br> Science, Maths & STEM | Diploma of Education (SCU) </h3> 
                    <p> Using my English language skills with my Science and technical background, since 2013, 
                        I have performed a range of teaching roles. These included teaching English as a forgein language 
                        (TEFL), Science, Maths and other STEM subjects such as robotics. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        This experience was invaluable for improving communication skills, especially in respect to 
                        being able to break-down and relay complex technical information to technically-untrained people.

                    <h3> Science & Technical Roles | Bachelor of Science (JCU) </h3> 
                    <p> Since 2008 I have worked in various scientific technical roles. 
                        I have worked with NSW DPI-Fisheries and Sydney water in technical field and lab roles. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through these scientific roles, I have gained experience with a range of methods and 
                        instruments for data collection. 
                    </p> 
                    <p> 
                        Additionally, I have experience in the sign making industry where I fabricated signage 
                        materials and wired LED lighting circuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These experieces also gave me a broad undertanding of government and business operations 
                        and the systems they depend on, such as laboratory information management systems (LIMS).
